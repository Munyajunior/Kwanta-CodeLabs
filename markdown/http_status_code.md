## 🚀 Understanding HTTP Methods & Status Codes

🧠 _What every developer should know for building robust web services_

---

Whether you're building websites, mobile apps, or backend APIs — **HTTP methods** are the verbs of the web.

They define **how** we interact with resources. Mastering them is key to building **secure**, **scalable**, and **well-structured** APIs.

---

### 🌐 Core HTTP Methods:

🔹 **GET** — _Retrieve_ data
✅ Safe & idempotent (no changes)

🔹 **POST** — _Create_ new data
📥 Sends data to the server

🔹 **PUT** — _Replace_ existing data
♻️ Overwrites full resource

🔹 **PATCH** — _Partially update_ data
✏️ Change specific fields only

🔹 **DELETE** — _Remove_ a resource
🗑 Clean and destructive action

---

### 📲 Real-World Examples:

| App Feature          | Method   | Endpoint     |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| View profile         | `GET`    | `/profile/`  |
| Register new user    | `POST`   | `/signup/`   |
| Update user info     | `PATCH`  | `/users/123` |
| Replace profile info | `PUT`    | `/users/123` |
| Delete account       | `DELETE` | `/users/123` |

---

### 📡 Essential HTTP Status Codes:

- ✅ `200 OK` — Success (GET, PUT, PATCH)
- 🆕 `201 Created` — Resource created (POST)
- 🚫 `400 Bad Request` — Malformed input
- 🔒 `401 Unauthorized` — No/invalid auth token
- ⛔ `403 Forbidden` — Authenticated but not allowed
- ❌ `404 Not Found` — Resource doesn’t exist
- 💥 `500 Internal Server Error` — Something broke on the server

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Status codes aren't just formalities — they improve clarity between frontend and backend, and they help with debugging, monitoring, and user feedback.

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters:

✅ Clean RESTful design
✅ Easier integration (frontend ↔ backend)
✅ More secure and predictable behavior
✅ Better tools: DevOps, observability, monitoring
